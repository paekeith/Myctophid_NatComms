The files in this folder are used to extract temperature and chlorophyll-a data to match to haul locations
for fish and zooplankton.

SST data for fish and zooplankton are in seperate files because the temporal range of fish and zooplankton 
samples differs by a handful of days, which was not realised until later on and therefore multiple datasets 
were downloaded.

The chlorophyll-a data are from the Copernicus dataset:
Global Ocean Colour (Copernicus-GlobColour), Bio-Geo-Chemical, L4 (monthly and interpolated) from Satellite Observations (1997-ongoing)

The files are too large to upload but the data are accessible using the bounding coordinates and times in the fish SST data
